This is a personal project of mine. I wanted to develop games since I first learned how to code in Java/JavaScript. After I took classes in learning professional practices in developing software, the user-friendly Unity game-development software, and the programming languages of C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and partial Python, I felt like I finally had the knowledge and wherewithal to start developing games in my free time.
This will be the first game I try to professionally develop. I'm hoping to add more features to my game and hopefully fully complete it. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy my game!
