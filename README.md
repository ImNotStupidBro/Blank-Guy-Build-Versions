This is a personal project of mine. I wanted to develop games since I first learned how to code in Java/JavaScript. After I took classes in learning professional practices in developing software, the user-friendly Unity game-development software, and the programming languages of C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and partial Python, I felt like I finally had the knowledge and wherewithal to start developing games in my free time.
This will be the first game I try to professionally develop. I'm hoping to add more features to my game and hopefully fully complete it. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy my game!

How to play:
1) Select the build version you'd like to play
2) Download and unzip the zip file of the folder
3) Run the .exe file you extract.

If you have difficulties running the game, feel free to create an issue ticket.
